## Article Abstract  
> Nanoparticles exhibit unique properties that are harnessed in various technological fields, yet their atomic structure remains complex and challenging to determine experimentally, especially for nanoclusters. This study explores the stability and structure of molybdenum-sulfur (Mo-S) nanoclusters using evolutionary algorithm USPEX and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We used a classification method based on "magic" clusters, where stability is evaluated through second-order energy differences and dissociation energies. Stability maps reveal that certain nanocluster compositions, specifically those with more than *n* molybdenum and *m* sulfur atoms, exhibit significant stability, where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 15, 1 ≤ *m* ≤ 20. This research provides insights into the structural stability of Mo-S nanoclusters, highlighting compositions that are energetically favorable and resistant to decomposition. We predicted 29 stable structures of Mo-S nanoclusters, only 7 of which have been previously synthesized experimentally. Among others, we also found metastable planar Mo<sub>10</sub>S<sub>20</sub> ring, which is the smallest possible planar Mo-S nanostructure. The thermodynamic and dynamic stability of the thin film and nanotube made of Mo<sub>10</sub>S<sub>20</sub> nanoclusters were also studied in this work. These findings enhance our understanding of nanocluster chemistry and contribute to the development of advanced nanomaterials.
